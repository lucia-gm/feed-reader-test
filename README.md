# Feed reader test
Used [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to write tests against a pre-existing application. This is part of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree.


## Project Overview
In this project we were given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds and the goal was learning how to use Jasmine to ensure that the application works as we expect it to do. 

To see the tests's code, go to **jasmin/spec/feedreader.js**.

To run the application, download or clone this repository and execute the file **index.html**.
